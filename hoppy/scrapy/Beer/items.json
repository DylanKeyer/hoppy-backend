Both only 24 at the time, we leased a building in Fraserburgh, got some scary bank loans, spent all our money on stainless steel and started making some hardcore craft beers.  We brewed tiny batches, filled bottles by hand and sold our beers at local markets and out of the back of our beat up old van.

He settled down in his hometown of Chicago\u2014a city perfect for craft beer, with rapidly evolving tastes and the largest system of fresh water on the planet. And then he got to brewing.  First he made some stellar beer. Then he invited his consumers in to watch his process at the brewery, bringing them behind the scenes every step of the way. The result was a new fascination with craft brewing, and beer that not only catered to people\u2019s tastes, but challenged them as well.  That was back in 1988, and we haven\u2019t slowed down since.
