 'description': 'Our famous beer began with a trip across Europe, when Goose '

                'too.”  Craft brewing wasn’t widely known at the time, but '
                'upon return from his European sojourn, John set out to change '
                'all that. He settled down in his hometown of Chicago—a city '
                'perfect for craft beer, with rapidly evolving tastes and the '
                'largest system of fresh water on the planet. And then he got '
                'to brewing.  First he made some stellar beer. Then he invited '
                'his consumers in to watch his process at the brewery, '

                'that not only catered to people’s tastes, but challenged them '
                'as well.  That was back in 1988, and we haven’t slowed down '
                'since. By 1995, John’s beer had become so popular that he '
                'decided to open a larger brewery, along with a bottling plant '
