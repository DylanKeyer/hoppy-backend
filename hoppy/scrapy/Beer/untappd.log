                'since. By 1995, John’s beer had become so popular that he '

                'decided to open a larger brewery, along with a bottling plant '

                'since. By 1995, John’s beer had become so popular that he '
                'decided to open a larger brewery, along with a bottling plant '

                'to himself, “America deserves some damn fine beer like this, '
                'too.”  Craft brewing wasn’t widely known at the time, but '
                'upon return from his European sojourn, John set out to change '
                'all that. He settled down in his hometown of Chicago—a city '
                'perfect for craft beer, with rapidly evolving tastes and the '
                'largest system of fresh water on the planet. And then he got '
                'to brewing.  First he made some stellar beer. Then he invited '
                'his consumers in to watch his process at the brewery, '
                'bringing them behind the scenes every step of the way. The '
                'result was a new fascination with craft brewing, and beer '
                'that not only catered to people’s tastes, but challenged them '
                'as well.  That was back in 1988, and we haven’t slowed down '
                'since. By 1995, John’s beer had become so popular that he '
                'decided to open a larger brewery, along with a bottling plant '
                'to keep up with demand. Today, what was once one man’s '
                'pint-filled dream has become the Goose Island empire you know '

                'Island founder (and unabashed beer lover) John Hall took a '
                'tour across the continent. Pint by pint, he savored the '
                'styles and selections of brews in every region, and thought '
                'to himself, “America deserves some damn fine beer like this, '
                'too.”  Craft brewing wasn’t widely known at the time, but '
                'upon return from his European sojourn, John set out to change '
                'all that. He settled down in his hometown of Chicago—a city '
                'perfect for craft beer, with rapidly evolving tastes and the '
                'largest system of fresh water on the planet. And then he got '
                'to brewing.  First he made some stellar beer. Then he invited '
                'his consumers in to watch his process at the brewery, '
                'bringing them behind the scenes every step of the way. The '
                'result was a new fascination with craft brewing, and beer '
                'that not only catered to people’s tastes, but challenged them '
                'as well.  That was back in 1988, and we haven’t slowed down '
                'since. By 1995, John’s beer had become so popular that he '
                'decided to open a larger brewery, along with a bottling plant '
                'to keep up with demand. Today, what was once one man’s '
                'pint-filled dream has become the Goose Island empire you know '
                'and love..',

                'largest system of fresh water on the planet. And then he got '

                'his consumers in to watch his process at the brewery, '
                'bringing them behind the scenes every step of the way. The '

                'that not only catered to people’s tastes, but challenged them '
                'as well.  That was back in 1988, and we haven’t slowed down '
                'since. By 1995, John’s beer had become so popular that he '
                'decided to open a larger brewery, along with a bottling plant '

                'since. By 1995, John’s beer had become so popular that he '
                'decided to open a larger brewery, along with a bottling plant '

                'largest system of fresh water on the planet. And then he got '

                'his consumers in to watch his process at the brewery, '

                'as well.  That was back in 1988, and we haven’t slowed down '
                'since. By 1995, John’s beer had become so popular that he '
                'decided to open a larger brewery, along with a bottling plant '
                'to keep up with demand. Today, what was once one man’s '
